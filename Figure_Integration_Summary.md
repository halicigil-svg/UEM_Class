# Figure Integration Summary

## Completed for Narrative Version ✓

Added all 8 figures with full legends at appropriate locations:

1. **Figure 1** (Lithium Plateau) → Section 3.1 after lithium discussion
2. **Figure 2** (Cosmological Posteriors) → Section 3.2 after timeline discussion
3. **Figure 3** (Hubble Tension) → Section 3.3 after H₀ resolution
4. **Figure 4** (SNe GeV) → Section 3.4 after supernova gamma-rays
5. **Figure 5** (Galaxy Gamma-Rays) → Section 3.4 after galaxy gamma-rays
6. **Figure 6** (Multi-Scale Summary) → Before RBH-1 section (shows all validations)
7. **Figure 7** (Beryllium Timeline) → Section 3.2 with timeline extension
8. **Figure 8** (Phase Cycle) → Section 4.1 cosmic timeline discussion

Each figure includes:
- Full panel-by-panel description
- Physical interpretation
- Statistical significance
- Connection to UEM predictions

## Still Needed for Complete v1.1 Manuscript

The complete technical manuscript (UEM_Complete_Manuscript_v1.1_with_RBH1.md) needs the same figure additions but with more technical detail matching its style.

Should I proceed with adding figures to the complete manuscript?
